Name: Kieran Halliday, worked alone
Time to complete: A while.
Sources: I spent a lot of time reading over forums relating to skip lists, class construction and struct declaration on StackOverflow and similar sites found on Google. I also had discussions with Andy Terzakian, Luigi Sacco, Kushal Kundanmal and Tavis Jaimeson; however, none of them were present when I actually wrote the code. For the online resouces, no code was adpated directly to my implementation except of course the snippets of code and basi algorithms given in the lab handout.
Files:
Index.cc -> the code I wrote, includes 2 structs and 1 class file used for part B.
README.txt -> this file
ch1.txt -> the file used to read the list of words
make -> a make file
